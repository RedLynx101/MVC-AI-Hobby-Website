# MVC Website

This is an example website that I mashed together for an assignment. I still spent some time making it look good. It showcases my use of Visual Studio, .NET, MVC, web-dev, and other things related to media, writing, and presentation.

You can run it yourself in Visual Studio by cloning this repository and running it using IIS Express.
